File-Based Storage System
A file-based storage system is a method of storing and managing data where information is stored in individual files, often within a hierarchical directory structure. Each file typically contains data related to a specific application or function, and users can access and manipulate these files directly using the operating systemâ€™s file management tools.

Key Characteristics:
Simplicity: File-based systems are straightforward to implement and understand, making them accessible for small-scale applications.
Direct Access: Users can access files directly using file paths and perform basic operations like create, read, update, and delete (CRUD).
Flexibility: Different file formats (e.g., text, CSV, JSON) can be used to store data, allowing for diverse applications.
Major Challenges of a File-Based Storage System
Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:

When multiple files store similar data, changes made in one file may not be reflected in others, leading to inconsistencies and redundancy.
Limited Data Access and Retrieval:

Accessing specific data in a file may require reading through the entire file, making retrieval inefficient, especially for large datasets.
Poor Data Security:

File-based systems generally lack robust security features. Unauthorized users may easily access or modify files, increasing the risk of data breaches.
Difficult Data Management:

As the number of files increases, managing, organizing, and locating specific files becomes challenging, often leading to a cluttered and disorganized file system.
Lack of Concurrency Control:

When multiple users or processes attempt to access or modify the same file simultaneously, conflicts can arise, resulting in data corruption or loss.
Scalability Issues:

File-based systems may struggle to scale effectively as data volume grows, leading to performance degradation and longer access times.
Backup and Recovery Complications:

Implementing effective backup and recovery solutions can be complex, especially if files are scattered across different locations or formats.
